# Rust Operating System

I wrote this as a bit of an exploration into how an OS builds, boots and handles itself at a lower level. I used the following tutorial:

[Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com)

I really encourage it's use, and Philipp Oppermann makes a really technical concept very easy to understand. The code in this repo is mostly his but wanted to publish this as my following along!

You can build the project with Rust Cargo and QEMU to run is a good choice. Follow the blog!
